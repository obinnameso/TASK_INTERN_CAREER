## Conclusion

* First of all we notice an increase in the number of attacks over the world between the year 1970 and 2014 after the which the number slightly decreases, this could be because of heightened security measures.
*  The middle East and Northern Africa is the the most affected region while the most affected country is Iraq with about 25000 attacks in over 9000 locations with 9 different weapons used, attacks mostly happened between 2004 and 2017.
* Only 3,67% of attack were suicide attacks with over half of the attacks happening in Iraq and Afghanistan.
* The year 2015 was the year with the highest amount of ransom paid to terrorists with about $277 million. And looking by region, Middle East and Northern Africa had the highest level of ransom paid with Iraq taking a huge chunk of the ransom hence the high level of attacks. <br>
