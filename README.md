## Conclusion

* First of all we notice an increase in the number of attacks over the world between the year 1970 and 2014(the rate had a peak in 2014) after the which the number slightly decreases, this could be because of heightened security measures.
*  The middle East and Northern Africa is the the most affected region while the most affected country is Iraq with about 25000 attacks in over 9000 locations with 9 different weapons used, attacks mostly happened between 2004 and 2017.
*  The most popular weapon used are Explosives.
* Only 3,67% of attack were suicide attacks with over half of the total attacks happening in Iraq and Afghanistan.
* The year 2015 was the year with the highest amount of ransom paid to terrorists with about $277 million. And looking by region, Middle East and Northern Africa had the highest level of ransom paid with Iraq taking a huge chunk of the ransom hence the high level of attacks. <br>
